Describe the Unity scene hierarchy and how it relates to GameObjects and
Components. (10 points)

The scene hierarchy contains the objects that constitutes it. 
The objects are children of the scene and each object has its own components that make up that object like scripts or built in components 
like transform component that gives it a physical position in the scene or box collider for physics collisions for example.

Objects in a scene can also have their own children objects and so that will for example effect the transform property of the children.
So moving the parent moves its children objects with it.
Game objects can also be empty but basically serve as containers for components and scenes serve as containers for game objects.
