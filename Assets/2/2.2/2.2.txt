Explain the difference between MonoBehaviours and ScriptableObjects. (10 points)

To attach a script to a game object it has to inherent from monobehaviour which is the base class from which every Unity script derives.
It is attached to the lifecycle of the game  object and is used to run your objects essentially. 
Attaching it to a game object makes a single instance of that class to run as the object of the class for that game object.

Scriptable objects are just data containers and are not tied to game objects but are rather used by other scripts to access data.
For example I can make a scriptable object class that defines the different aspects of a character, then I can make multiple instances
of that class in the project files as Bob, Sam and Jade. Then using say a character selection class I can access one of those data container
instances, say Bob and feed it into a Monobehaviour class say Character, giving that class the data from the scriptable object making this 
generic character you could say, into Bob.
Its great because you can edit it in the inspector and quickly make different versions, like different gun types.
