 Explain the concept of a Render Pipeline in Unity and how it affects rendering. (10
points)

Rendering has many steps, thats the pipeline. Like a factory assembly line that convert
3D scene data into a pretty 2D end product to display on the screen.
What is part of the pipleline effects how that final frame looks and how long it takes to produce it.

Unity has a few options , the old one called the built in render pipeline, which is fine for normal use.
Universal render pipeline which has cooler features and better performance, so good for mobile (weak devices) and VR which is a hungry beast.
High Definition Render Pipeline , basically for your latest unreal engine demo look. 
So your AAA real time ray tracing, physically based rendering stuff.

The rendering pipeline has stages such as:
Scene stage: How and what actually gets rendered.
Geometry Stage: Raw 3D data calculations and transformations.
Lighting Stage: Determines how lighting interacts and effects things.
Shader Stage: Applies the shader code to the materials defining their appearance.
Post processing: Adds all the cool stuff like your lovely overblown 2000s bloom and depth of field that I wish more games did right.
