Describe the differences between AR and VR development in Unity, including the use of
XRSession and XRNode. (10 points)

AR for putting the monster under my bed, VR for living in the monsters world.
An XRSession creates a session with the devices that we need the data from. 
With AR that's tracking camera movement, detect where the surfaces around you are and 
recognize real world objects. Unity supports AR core and AEKit to interface with the android or ios device to get that special data.
With VR the XRSession is for configuring the tracking for the headsets and controller.

XRNodes are essentially the nodes on the players body, that's how I see it. A node for the head (AR - the camera, VR - the headset) and then
a node each for each hand if the player has hand controllers. The nodes are used to get position and rotation data.
