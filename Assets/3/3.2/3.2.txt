Explain how to set up a basic XR project in Unity, including camera configuration using
XRCamera and XRNode. (10 points)

1 XR package setup
	1.1 open a universal render pipeline 3D unity project 
	1.2 From the package manager install XR plugin management and XR interaction toolkit
	1.3 Choose the options you want to support in project settings XR plugin management. 
	So like are we using oculus , open xr or mock hdm loader.

2 XR Origin and XR camera
	2.1 Add a XR origin game object to the scene.
	2.2 The XR Camera is a child of XR origin , you can adjust the field of view and clipping planes in the inspector.
	
3 XR Nodes
	3.1 XR Origin automatically manages the tracking of XRNode.Head , XRNode.LeftHand and XRNode.RightHand
	but for manual tracking you can use InputDevices such as InputDevice leftHandDevice = InputDevices.GetDeviceAtXRNode(XRNode.LeftHand);
	3.2 Unity has a the default controllers prefab to visualize the hands in VR but you can use your own colliders and renderers to show 
	something else like hands in the place of it.
	3.3 To add actions like grabbing you can use button inputs from XRNode.LeftHand and XRNode.Righthand
	
4 XR Ray Interactor
	4.1 XRInteractorLineVisual can let you use ray cast to do point and click interactions like you would with a mouse.
