Explain the difference between static and instance members in a class. (10 points)

An instance member is a single object created from a class.
So Character Bob = new Character (); creates a new instance of the character class and stores it in Bob.
To access that instance of the character class I have to access it via that specific object so Bob.Speak();

With a static member I can have a class say called Main be static and so it only has one instance of it, it cant make more instances of itself.
I can also give a class that isn't static itself static members like public static int CharacterCount; can keep track of how many instances
we have made of this class with a static method public static void IncrementCharacterCount() {CharacterCount++;} Ofcourse there can only be one 
character count in this situation, to count for all the objects of this class and so its static and the method to increment it is also static.
